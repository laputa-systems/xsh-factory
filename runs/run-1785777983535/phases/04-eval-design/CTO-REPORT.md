# CTO briefing 04-eval-design

This is the deterministic first-pass briefing for the CTO. The structured
`report.json` files and raw Pi sessions remain the source of truth.

## Result

fail

## Operating context

- Mode: `eval-design`
- Request: `CYCLE-REQUEST.md`
- Structured report: `report.json`

## Phase outcomes

- `report.json`: result `fail`; report `report.json`
- `workers/eval-designer/proposal-1/report.json`: result `pass`; report `workers/eval-designer/proposal-1/report.json`


## Employee accounting

### Worker metrics

- `eval-designer/proposal-1` (`eval-designer`): result `pass`; report `workers/eval-designer/proposal-1/report.json`
  - Execution: `not recorded`; classification: `not recorded`
  - Turns: `33`; bucket tokens: `1134379`; thinking blocks: `32`
  - Tool errors: `0`; cost: `0.034178`; budget: `0.300000`


### Nonzero tool results

No nonzero Pi tool results were recorded.

### Cycle total

- Workers: `1`
- Assistant turns: `33`
- Bucket tokens: `1134379`
- Cost (USD): `0.034178`
- Nonzero tool results: `0`
- Budget failures or unknown costs: `0`


## Employee decisions

### eval-designer/proposal-1

## Eval proposal review

`{relative_path(run_dir, review)}`

# CTO eval review

## Eval

`task-tags`

## Result

`rejected`

## Evidence

The package was preserved for inspection, but one or more CTO review gates did not pass.

- Proposal: `runs/run-1785777983535/phases/04-eval-design/proposals/proposal-1`

## Promotion

`not-promoted` at `evals/task-tags`.

## Package state

`complete`

Missing package files: `None.`.

Checked-in status: `Draft.`.

Promotion records the proposal for Git review. The CTO may set `Approved.`
after the evaluator and evidence pass; promotion alone does not admit a
package to a paid cycle.


## CTO action queue

Review the structured report and employee narratives before the next paid cycle.

## Evidence index

- Structured run or phase report: `report.json`
- Raw employee sessions and structured worker reports: `workers/`
- Factory improvement handoff: `CTO-IMPROVEMENT.md` (required; next CTO must
  validate or revert it before paid work)
