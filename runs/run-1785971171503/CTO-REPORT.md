# CTO briefing run-1785971171503

This is the deterministic first-pass briefing for the CTO. The structured
`report.json` files and raw Pi sessions remain the source of truth.

## Outcome dimensions

- Product: `fail`
- Evaluator: `fail`
- Infrastructure: `pass`

## Operating context

- Mode: `organization`
- Request: `CYCLE-REQUEST.md`
- Structured report: `report.json`

## Phase outcomes

- `phases/01-ticket/report.json`: result `fail`; report `phases/01-ticket/report.json`
- `phases/03-eval/report.json`: result `fail`; report `phases/03-eval/report.json`
- `phases/03-eval/workers/eval-worker/task-histogram-1/report.json`: result `pass`; report `phases/03-eval/workers/eval-worker/task-histogram-1/report.json`


## Employee accounting

### Worker metrics

- `phases/03-eval/workers/eval-worker/task-histogram-1/report.json` (`unknown`): result `pass`; report `phases/03-eval/workers/eval-worker/task-histogram-1/report.json`
  - Execution: `pass`; classification: `pass`
  - Turns: `48`; bucket tokens: `942252`; thinking blocks: `40`
  - Provider telemetry: `present=true; retries=0; retry_delay_ms=0; retry_successes=0; retry_failures=0; provider_errors=unknown; event_turns=48; observed_output_tps=0`
  - Tool errors: `0`; cost: `0.025788`; budget: `0.500000`


### Nonzero tool results
### Provider health and latency

Provider retry, latency, and attribution data are in worker `report.json`
`provider_telemetry` fields. Missing telemetry is `unknown`, not evidence of
normal provider health. Provider switching is out of scope and tracked in
`TODO.md`.

### Nonzero tool results

No nonzero Pi tool results were recorded.

### Cycle total

- Workers: `1`
- Assistant turns: `48`
- Bucket tokens: `942252`
- Cost (USD): `0.025788`
- Nonzero tool results: `0`
- Budget failures or unknown costs: `0`


## Employee decisions

No employee narratives were found.

## Eval proposal review
